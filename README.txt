 ---------------------------------
 -User has the ability to find a pattern in a text when the pattern contains “wild-cards”.
  A wild-card is a special “symbol” which is meant to match any letter. For this assignment only, the underscore is considered as a wildcard.
  For illustration, the “pattern” c_g can be found in the following “text” cogwrgaccag two times (at the beginning and at the end).

 -Text should not contain the “_”-symbol (the underscore).

 -The pattern is allowed to contain more than one wild-card.

 -Find all positions where the pattern is found.

 -Allow to enter empty text and empty pattern.

 -Support for any operating system.

 USAGE
 ---------------------------------
 -Download files any where on your computer.
 -Extract Test.zip file in same folder.
 -Download and install Dev-C++ application to your PC(Already have in PC this not need)
  (Download Dev-C++ - https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/)
 -Open application.cpp file in 19001215 folder with Dev-C++.
 -Click on 'Execute' in upper menu bar and click 'Compile & Run'.
 -Enter text without underscore(_) symbol and after enter pattern with or without underscore(_) in appear console.

 RUNNING TESTS	
 ---------------------------------
 -Download 19001215.zip file any where on your computer.
 -Extract files in zip file.
 -Download and install Dev-C++ application to your PC(Already have in PC this not need)
  (Download Dev-C++ - https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/)
 -Open test_run.cpp file in 19001215 folder with Dev-C++.
 -Click on 'Execute' in upper menu bar and click 'Compile & Run'.
 -Test cases run in order by continue and to stop run next test case enter 'N' or 'n' when ask 'Continue?'

 Tests are scripted and can be executed with test_run.cpp file

 All test cases and its outputs are located inside the 'Test' directory. 
 All text files are in 'Text' directoty in 'Test' directory and All pattern files are in 'Pattern' directoty in 'Test' directory.
 All output files are in 'Output' directoty in 'Test' directory.
 (eg: text1.txt is in Test/Text/, pattern1.txt is in Test/Pattern/ and patternmatch1.output is in Test/Output/.)

 Test cases are run in order until do not continue.
 Text and Pattern in corresponding files are read and its output store to corresponding output file.
 (eg: pattern in pattern.txt is searched in text in text1.txt. And its output is stored in patternmatch1.txt)
